# Derived from
# OpenRadio v1.1 Quisk Configuration File
# 
# IMPORTANT: To be able to control the OpenRadio board from within Quisk,
# you will need to compile and upload the 'openradio_quisk' firmware, which
# is available from: https://github.com/darksidelemm/open_radio_miniconf_2015
#
# You will also need to install the pyserial package for python.
